## 🎯 Purpose  
This project was created to:  
- Help Kenyan employees easily calculate **PAYE tax deductions** and **net income**.  
- Provide a real-world example of how JavaScript can handle business logic (tax computation).  
- Serve as a learning project for frontend developers working with user input and computation logic.

## ✨ Features  
✅ Accepts **gross monthly salary** input.  
✅ Calculates PAYE tax using **official KRA tax bands**.  
✅ Displays **net salary** and **tax amount** clearly.  
✅ Fully **client-side** — no backend or database required.  
✅ Simple, responsive interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. User enters **gross monthly salary** in Kenyan Shillings.  
2. The script computes **taxable income** and applies the correct **PAYE tax brackets**:  
   | Monthly Band (KES) | Annual Band (KES) | Rate |
   |--------------------|-------------------|-------|
   | First 24,000       | First 288,000     | 10%   |
   | Next 8,333         | Next 100,000      | 25%   |
   | Next 467,667       | Next 5,612,000    | 30%   |
   | Next 300,000       | Next 3,600,000    | 32.5% |
   | Above 800,000      | Above 9,600,000   | 35%   |
3. A **personal relief** of KSh 2,400 per month (KSh 28,800 per annum) is deducted.  
4. The resulting **tax due** is subtracted from the gross salary to yield the **net salary**.  

> ℹ️ Depending on version, other deductions such as **NSSF**, **SHIF**, or **Housing Levy** may be added later.
